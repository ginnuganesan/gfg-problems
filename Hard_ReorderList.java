/* PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given a singly linked list: A0→A1→...→An-2→An-1, reorder it to: A0→An-1→A1→An-2→A2→An-3→...
For example: Given 1->2->3->4->5 its reorder is 1->5->2->4->3.

Note: It is recommended do this in-place without altering the node's values.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3
Output: 1 3 2
Explanation:
Here n=3, so the correct
order is A0→A2→A1
Example 2:

Input:
Explanation: 1->7->3->4
Output: 1 4 7 3
Explanation:
Here n=4, so the correct
order is A0→A3→A1→A2
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function reorderList() which should reorder the list as required. The reorder list is automatically printed by the driver's code.

Note: Try to solve without using any auxilliary space.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 5*105
0 <= A[ i ] <= 105
