/* PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given a singly linked list, the task is to rearrange it in a way that all odd position nodes are together and all even positions node are together.
Assume the first element to be at position 1 followed by second element at position 2 and so on.
Note: You should place all odd positioned nodes first and then the even positioned ones. (considering 1 based indexing). Also, the relative order of odd positioned nodes and even positioned nodes should be maintained.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4
Output: 1 3 2 4 
Explanation: 
Odd elements are 1, 3 and even elements are 
2, 4. Hence, resultant linked list is 
1->3->2->4.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 1 3 5 2 4 
Explanation: 
Odd elements are 1, 3, 5 and even elements are
2, 4. Hence, resultant linked list is
1->3->5->2->4.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function rearrangeEvenOdd() which rearranges the nodes in the linked list as required and doesn't return anything.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ Size of the linked list ≤ 104
0 ≤ value of linked list ≤ 103
