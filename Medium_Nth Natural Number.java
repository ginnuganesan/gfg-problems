/* PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given a positive integer n. You have to find nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing the digit 9.

Examples :

Input: n = 8
Output: 8
Explanation: After removing natural numbers which contains digit 9, first 8 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 8th number is 8.
Input: n = 9
Output: 10
Explanation: After removing natural numbers which contains digit 9, first 9 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 and 9th number is 10.
Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 109

//Solution

class Solution {
    long findNth(long n) {
        // code here
        long out = 0;
        long unitMultiplier = 1;
        
        while(n > 0) {
            out += unitMultiplier * (n % 9);
            n = n / 9;
            unitMultiplier = unitMultiplier * 10;
        }
        return out;
    }
}
