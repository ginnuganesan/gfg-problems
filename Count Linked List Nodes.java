/* PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 5, which is its length.
Input: LinkedList : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the linked list is 7. Hence, the output is 7.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data <= 103

*/

//Solution

class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int a){  data = a; next = null; }
}*/

class Solution
{
    //Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public static int getCount(Node head)
    {
        
        //Code here
        Node temp = head;
        int count = 0;
        while(temp != null) {
            count++;
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
